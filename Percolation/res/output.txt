Testing methods in Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), we check the return
values of isOpen(i, j) for every (i, j), the return value of percolates(),
and the return value of isFull(i, j) for every (i, j), in that order.

Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

Test 1: Open predetermined list of sites using file inputs
  *  filename = input6.txt
  *  filename = input8.txt
  *  filename = input8-no.txt
  *  filename = input10-no.txt

==> passed

Test 4: Check for backwash with predetermined sites
  *  filename = input20.txt
     isFull(18, 1) returns wrong value [after 231 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 231 to isOpen()
  *  filename = input10.txt
     isFull(9, 1) returns wrong value [after 56 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 56 to isOpen()
  *  filename = input50.txt
     isFull(22, 28) returns wrong value [after 1412 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 1412 to isOpen()
  *  filename = jerry47.txt
     isFull(11, 47) returns wrong value [after 1076 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 1076 to isOpen()
==> FAILED

Test 5: Check for backwash with predetermined sites that have
        multiple percolating paths
  *  filename = input3.txt
     isFull(3, 1) returns wrong value [after 4 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 4 to isOpen()

     - reference = false
     - failed after call 7 to isOpen()
  *  filename = input7.txt
     isFull(6, 1) returns wrong value [after 12 sites opened]
     - student   = true
     - reference = false
     - failed after call 12 to isOpen()
==> FAILED

Test 6: Predetermined sites with long percolating path
  *  filename = snake13.txt
  *  filename = snake101.txt
==> passed

Test 7: Opens every site
  *  filename = input5.txt

Test 8: Open random sites until just before system percolates,
        allowing open() to be called on a site more than once

         (to make sure you didn't store data in static variables)
==> passed

         but change the order in which methods are called

Running time in seconds depends on the machine on which the script runs,
and  varies each time that you submit. If one of the values in the table
violates the performance limits, the factor by which you failed the test
appears in parentheses. For example, (9.6x) in the union() column
indicates that it uses 9.6x too many calls.


Tests 2a-2d: Check whether number of calls to union(), connected(), and find()
             is a constant per call to open(), isFull(), and percolates().
             The table shows the maximum number of union(), connected(), and
             find() calls made during a single call to open(), isFull(), and
